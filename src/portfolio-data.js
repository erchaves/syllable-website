In its press release, this online tool was called the \"first in the museum field designed to search [holdings\/art works] with a deep focus on visual properties such as light, line, color, and space, in addition to more traditional searches by artist name, media, or historical movement.\"The project was led by Shelley Bernstein, the Barnes Foundation deputy director for audience engagement &amp; chief experience officer. And it was funded by a $155,000 grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The code is open source. The collection enables visitors to explore thousands of works in the Barnes\u2019s unparalleled collection based on aesthetics, and download high-resolution images of over 1,400 works that are in the public domain.https:\/\/www.barnesfoundation.org\/press\/press-releases\/launch-of-new-framework-for-searching-collection-online"},{"id":346164491,"project_id":58835823,"type":"image","full_bleed":1,"alignment":"center","caption_alignment":"left","src":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/disp\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","sizes":{"disp":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/disp\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","max_1240":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/hd\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","max_1920":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/fs\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","max_1200":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/max_1200\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","1400":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/1400\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","max_3840":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/max_3840\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png","original":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/source\/1ee79358835823.5a0b3d8231a2d.png"},"dimensions":{"disp":{"width":600,"height":600},"max_1240":{"width":1240,"height":1240},"max_1920":{"width":1920,"height":1920},"max_1200":{"width":1200,"height":1200},"1400":{"width":1400,"height":1400},"max_3840":{"width":2530,"height":2530},"original":{"width":2530,"height":2530}},"width":600,"height":600},{"id":346164495,"project_id":58835823,"type":"image","full_bleed":1,"alignment":"center","caption_alignment":"left","src":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/disp\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","sizes":{"disp":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/disp\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","max_1240":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/hd\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","max_1920":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/fs\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","max_1200":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/max_1200\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","1400":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/1400\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","max_3840":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/max_3840\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png","original":"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/source\/54116658835823.5a0b3d823216a.png"},"dimensions":{"disp":{"width":600,"height":600},"max_1240":{"width":1240,"height":1240},"max_1920":{"width":1920,"height":1920},"max_1200":{"width":1200,"height":1200},"1400":{"width":1400,"height":1400},"max_3840":{"width":2530,"height":2530},"original":{"width":2530,"height":2530}},"width":600,"height":600}],"short_url":"http:\/\/be.net\/gallery\/58835823\/Software-Development-Barnes-Foundation-Collection","copyright":{"license":"cc by-nc-nd","description":"Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs","license_id":1},"tools":[{"id":88622327,"title":"Node.js","category":"9","category_label":"Software","category_id":9,"synonym":null,"approved":"0","url":"\/search?tools=88622327"},{"id":6189,"title":"JavaScript","category":"11","category_label":"Online App","category_id":11,"synonym":null,"approved":"1","url":"\/search?tools=6189"}],"styles":{"text":{"title":{"font_family":"arial,helvetica,sans-serif","font_weight":"bold","color":"#191919","text_align":"left","line_height":"1.1em","font_size":"36px","text_decoration":"none","font_style":"normal","display":"inline","text_transform":"none"},"subtitle":{"font_family":"arial,helvetica,sans-serif","font_weight":"normal","color":"#a4a4a4","text_align":"left","line_height":"1.4em","font_size":"20px","text_decoration":"none","font_style":"normal","display":"inline","text_transform":"none"},"paragraph":{"font_family":"arial,helvetica,sans-serif","font_weight":"normal","color":"#696969","text_align":"left","line_height":"1.4em","font_size":"20px","text_decoration":"none","font_style":"normal","display":"inline","text_transform":"none"},"caption":{"font_family":"arial,helvetica,sans-serif","font_weight":"normal","color":"#a4a4a4","text_align":"left","line_height":"1.4em","font_size":"14px","text_decoration":"none","font_style":"italic","display":"block","text_transform":"none"},"link":{"font_family":"arial,helvetica,sans-serif","font_weight":"normal","color":"#1769FF","text_align":"left","line_height":"1.4em","font_size":"12px","text_decoration":"none","font_style":"normal","display":"inline","text_transform":"none"}},"background":{"color":"FFFFFF"},"spacing":{"project":{"top_margin":0},"modules":{"bottom_margin":60}},"dividers":{"display":"none"}},"creator_id":856469},"http_code":200},
